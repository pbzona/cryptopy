# Cryptopals Solutions

These are my solutions to the Cryptopals cryptography challenges in Python.

**Don't look in this project if you don't want to see the solutions. If you're going through the challenges, seek help in other ways before looking at completed problems.**

If you're interested in cryptography and want to try these out for yourself, check out the [Cryptopals site](https://cryptopals.com/).
